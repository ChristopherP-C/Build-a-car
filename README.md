# Build-A-Car

  ## Description
    I wanted a project which allowed me to create and store vehicle data, and perform various specific actions on them.
    This project was made to store information to be returned later at users request.
    This project can be used to store information for clients, create test enviornments, or show the framewrok for how certain vehicles should be expected to run.
    This project helped cement the fundamentals of object class coding, and how to make them work off of each other to create more complex objects.

When viewing a vehicle, users are able to perform various actions on it, such as starting, accelerating, reversing, or other vehicle specific actions on the chosen vehivle.
